## üìå Project Overview

- **Dataset**: [Kaggle - Diabetes Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set)
- **Goals**:  
  - Analyze associations between independent variables and diabetes onset  
  - Clean and preprocess data using medical domain knowledge  
  - Compare model performance using Logistic Regression and Random Forest  
  - Interpret performance differences via feature importance analysis

## üîç Key Analysis Steps

1. **Definition of Medical Features and Preprocessing Criteria**

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle outliers through removal or replacement with mean/median values  
   - Apply log transformation and standard scaling (StandardScaler)  
   - Check multicollinearity using VIF (Variance Inflation Factor)

3. **Model Training and Comparison**  
   - Train `Logistic Regression` and `Random Forest` classifiers  
   - Evaluate using Confusion Matrix, F1 Score, ROC-AUC, etc.

4. **Conclusion**

  - Both models perform well in terms of ROC-AUC  
  - Logistic Regression outperforms in Accuracy, Precision, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC, while Random Forest shows higher Recall  
  - The limited role of the Pregnancies variable in Random Forest may help explain its relatively higher recall
